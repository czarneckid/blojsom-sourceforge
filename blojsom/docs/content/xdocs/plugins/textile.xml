                The Textile plugin is an implementation of the amazing Textile Humane Web Text Generator.
                You can see the original at the
                <link href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textism Textile</link>
                site.

            <title>installation and setup</title>
            <p>
                In your
                <em>plugin.properties</em> file, add the following line:
            </p>
            <source>
                textile=org.ignition.blojsom.plugin.textile.TextilePlugin
            </source>
            <p>

                You may then add "textile" to one of the flavor-based plugin chains. For example:
            </p>
            <source>
                html.blojsom-plugin-chain=textile
            </source>
            <p>
                In your
                <em>blojsom.properties</em> be sure to add
                <code>.*textile</code> to the
                <em>blog-file-extensions</em> value.
                The textile plugin uses
                <strong>.textile</strong> to identify blog entries that should be passed through
                the plugin for processing, so be sure your entries end with this extension if you want this
                plugin to work correctly.

                No context attributes are made available or used by the Textile plugin.

                h2. This is a title

                h3. This is a subhead

                This is some text of dubious character. Isn't the use of "quotes" just lazy writing -- and
                theft of 'intellectual property' besides? I think the time has come to see a block quote.

                bq. This is a block quote. I'll admit it's not the most exciting block quote ever devised.

                Well, that went well. How about we insert
                an &lt;a href="/" title="watch out"&gt;old-fashioned hypertext link&lt;/a&gt;?
                Will the quote marks in the tags get messed up? No!

                "This is a link (optional title)":http://www.textism.com

                An image:

                !/common/textist.gif(optional alt text)!

                # Librarians rule
                # Yes they do
                # But you knew that

                Some more text of dubious character. Here is a noisome string of CAPITAL letters.
                Here is something we want to _emphasize_.
                That was a linebreak. And something to indicate *strength*. Of course I could
                use &lt;em&gt;my own HTML tags&lt;/em&gt; if I &lt;strong&gt;felt&lt;/strong&gt; like it.

                h3. Coding

                This &lt;code&gt;is some code, "isn't it"&lt;/code&gt;. Watch those quote marks!
                Now for some preformatted text:

                &lt;pre&gt;
                &lt;code&gt;
                $text = str_replace("&lt;p&gt;%::%&lt;/p&gt;","",$text);
                $text = str_replace("%::%&lt;/p&gt;","",$text);
                $text = str_replace("%::%","",$text);

                &lt;/code&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;

                This isn't code.


                So you see, my friends:

                * The time is now
                * The time is not later
                * The time is not yesterday
                * We must act
