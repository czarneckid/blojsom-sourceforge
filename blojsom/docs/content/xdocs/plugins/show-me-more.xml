                The "More ..." plugin will truncate long entries and add a hyperlink to the
                description so that the user can view the full text of the entry.

            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>installation and setup</title>
            <p>
                In your
                <em>plugin.properties</em> file, add the following line:
            </p>
            <source>
                show-me-more=org.ignition.blojsom.plugin.showmore.ShowMeMorePlugin
            </source>
            <p>

                You may then add "show-me-more" to one of the flavor-based plugin chains. For example:
            </p>
            <source>
                html.blojsom-plugin-chain=show-me-more
            </source>
            <p>

                The "more ..." plugin has its own configuration file that is referenced in
                <em>web.xml</em>. For example:
            </p>
            <source>
                &lt;init-param&gt;
                &lt;param-name&gt;plugin-showmemore&lt;/param-name&gt;
                &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/showmemore.properties&lt;/param-value&gt;
                &lt;/init-param&gt;
            </source>
            <p>

                The
                <em>showmemore.properties</em> contains two configurable parameters:
            </p>
            <source>
                entry-length-cutoff=400
                entry-text-cutoff=&lt;more/&gt;
                show-me-more-text=More ...
            </source>
            <p>

                <em>entry-length-cutoff</em> defines the number of characters after which the link to view the
                full text of the entry will be placed.
                <br/>
                <em>entry-text-cutoff</em> defines a special tag or string that you can use in your blog entry to
                define the place where the plugin should insert a link to view the full text of the entry. If
                this parameter is present and defined, it will override the
                <em>entry-length-cutoff</em> parameter.
                <br/>
                <em>show-me-more-text</em> controls the text of the hyperlink to view the full text of the entry.

                <p>
                    There is nothing special you have to do to your blog entries. Blog entries that are shorter
                    than the length defined in
                    <em>entry-length-cutoff</em> will not have a link added to their
                    description.

                    The following table describes the URL parameters that affect the output of the "more ..." plugin.
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>URL parameter</th>
                        <th>Accepted values</th>
                        <th>Usage</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>smm</td>
                        <td>If "smm" is set to "y", the plugin will not be executed on entries. This is used when generating the link to the entry with the full description.</td>
                        <td>/blog/?smm=y</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
