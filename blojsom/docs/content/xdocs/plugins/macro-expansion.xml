The macro expansion plugin expands <em>$macro$</em> references that it finds in your blog description and expands
them into its full form.
</p><p>
It is a timesaver plugin to save you from repeatedly typing in
portions of blog entries that you use over and over again. For example, you might want to be
able to expand friend's names into URLs that point to their blogs.

<p>
In your <em>plugin.properties</em> file, add the following line:
</p>
<source>
macro-expansion=org.ignition.blojsom.plugin.macro.MacroExpansionPlugin
</source>
<p>

You may then add "macro-expansion" to one of the flavor-based plugin chains. For example:
</p>
<source>
html.blojsom-plugin-chain=macro-expansion
</source>

<p>
The macro expansion plugin has its own configuration file that is referenced in <em>web.xml</em>. For example:
</p><source>
    &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;plugin-macros-expansion&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/macros.properties&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/init-param&gt;
</source>
<p>

The <em>macros.properties</em> contains <em>key=value</em> pairs like the following:
</p>
<source>
blojsom=http://blojsom.sf.net
ypm=Yeah, Pretty Much
</source>
</section><section><title>usage and URL parameters</title>
<p>
In your entries, simply reference your macros using the <em>$macro$</em> syntax. The <em>$macro$</em> references
are also case insensitive.
</p><p>

For example, "... and then he said, $ypm$ " in your blog description would expand to
"... and then he said, Yeah, Pretty Much "
