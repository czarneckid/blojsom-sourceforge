      <answer>
        <p>
          blojsom is an acronym for (blo)gging in (j)ava ... (so)mewhat ... (m)aybe.
I was looking for a way to play off the name,
<link href="http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom">blosxom</link>, blojsom's not-so-distant "relative",
and blojsom stuck.

      <question>
        How do I create my first blog entry?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          blojsom renders your blog based on what files it finds in the directory you set as your
<em>blog-home</em> (see <link href="site:installation">installation</link>). In this directory, each
individual file is treated as a seperate blog entry. You can control which files are processed
and which are ignored using the <em>blog-file-extentions</em> and <em>blog-directory-filter</em>
entries in <em>/WEB-INF/blojsom.properties</em>.

      <question>
        How do I create different blog categories?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
           All you have to do is simply create new directories underneath your <em>blog-home</em>
directory and blojsom will automatically recognize them as categories. You can further
control the categories using optional meta-data, an example is a more descriptive name for
the category. See <link href="site:customization">customization</link> for more details.
