                    <li>Servlet 2.3 compliant application server (e.g. Jakarta Tomcat 4.1.18)</li>
                    <li>Java 1.4.x runtime</li>

                <p>
                    1. Download
                    <link href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/blojsom">blojsom</link>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Unpack
                    <em>blojsom.war</em> using Java's JAR program (jar xvf blojsom.war) into a directory
                    under where the application server will be running blojsom.
                    Under Tomcat, this might be $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/blojsom. In this case, the servlet context
                    for blojsom will be "blojsom".

                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Configure the
                    <em>WEB-INF/blojsom.properties</em> file for your blog.

                            <em>web.xml</em> file, then you will need to make sure that change is reflected in the URL

                    4. Start your application server. On startup, blojsom will log messages to the console to
                    indicate what it is doing. Configuring blojsom's log capability is described on
                    the
                    <link href="custom.html">customization</link> page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Start your browser and open the URL to your blog. Example:
                    <em>http://localhost:8080/blojsom/blog/</em>.
                    Your new blog should show up in your browser. Now you're ready to create categories and entries for your blog.

            <section>
                <title>Adding, removing, and updating blog entries and categories</title>
                <p>
                    blojsom uses the filesystem as its database. In blojsom, files matching the files indicated in the
                    <em>blog-file-extensions</em> configuration property will be picked up as your
                    blog entries. Directories that blojsom discovers under
                    <em>blog-home</em> will be used as the categories for your blog. The following is an oversimplified example of how to
                    manipulate your blog to add, update, and remove blog entries and categories.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>blojsom blog entry format</title>
                <p>The first line of a blojsom blog entry is used as the title for that entry. Everything after that is treated as the body or description
                    of that blog entry. The filename of the blog entry will be used in generating a "permalink" (a permanent link) to that individual blog entry.
                </p>

                <source>
                    This is a blog entry title
                    And everything after will show up as the body for the blog entry
                </source>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Adding blog entries and categories</title>
                <p>
                    1. Change to your
                    <em>blog-home</em> directory.
                    <br/>
                    2. Add a directory called "general". There you go, you've just created a category!
                    <br/>
                    3. Open up your favorite editor and create a file called "my-first-entry.html" in the "general" directory. Again, the first line of your blog entry is used
                    as the title and everything after the title will be used as the body of the entry.
                    <br/>
                    4. In your browser, open up the URL to your blog and you should see your entry displayed on the screen.
                    <br/>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Updating blog entries and categories</title>
                <p>

                    1. Change to your
                    <em>blog-home</em> directory.
                    <br/>
                    2. Rename the "general" directory to "news". There you go, you've just updated a category!
                    <br/>
                    3. Open up your favorite editor and edit the file "my-first-entry.html", now in the "news" directory. Update the title and/or the entry body. It's that simple.
                    <br/>
                    4. In your browser, open up the URL to your blog and you should see your entry displayed on the screen.

                    1. Change to your
                    <em>blog-home</em> directory.

                    2. Remove the "news" directory. There you go, you've just removed a category (and removed your first blog entry)!

                    After blojsom is setup and running, your users will be able to navigate around your blog in those categories that have entries. No surprise there, eh?!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following table describes the URL parameters that blojsom accepts and how they affect the entries that get displayed by your blog.
                </p>
