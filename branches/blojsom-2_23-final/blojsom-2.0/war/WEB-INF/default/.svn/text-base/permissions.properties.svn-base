# Permissions configuration file
#
# The format of the file is as follows:
#
# authorized-user-id=permission
#
# Where authorized-user-id is a user ID from the authorization.properties file
#
# Each permission goes on a separate line, for example:
#
# default=permission_1
# default=permission_2

# To give a user all permissions, use a permission of '*', for example:
#
# default=*
default=*
