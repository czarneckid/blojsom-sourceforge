            <p>
                The trackback auto-discovery plugin implements the
                <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mttrackback.html#autodiscovery%20of%20trackback%20ping%20urls">auto-discovery mechanism</a>
                from the MovableType Trackback Technical Specification.

                    In your global
                    <code>plugin.properties</code> file, add the following line:
                </p>
                <source>
                    auto-trackback=org.blojsom.plugin.trackback.AutoTrackbackPlugin
                </source>
                <p>You may then add "auto-trackback" to one of the flavor-based plugin chains.
                These plugin chains can be found in the individual user's
                <code>plugin.properties</code> file. For example:
                </p>
                <source>
                    html.blojsom-plugin-chain=auto-trackback
                </source>

                    <title>Usage</title>
                    <p>
                        The following is a sample blog entry:
                        <pre>
                            This is my entry title

                            This is the body of my blog entry. This is a ping to some <a href="http://www.someurl.com">Some URL</a>
                            which the trackback auto-discovery plugin will try to discover its proper trackback
                            ping URL and send it to it.

                            meta-auto-trackback=true
                        </pre>
                        As you will notice here, this demonstrates the use of the meta plugin in conjunction with the
                        trackback auto-discovery plugin. The trackback auto-discovery plugin works by looking for the
                        meta-data "auto-trackback" which must have a value of <code>true</code> for the plugin to
                        execute the auto-discovery process on the blog entry. After completing trackback auto-discovery, the
                        plugin will write the meta-data "auto-trackback-complete" with a value of <code>true</code> back
                        to that entry. Note that the auto-trackback plugin should be placed after the meta plugin in one
                        of the flavor-based plugin chains where the auto-trackback plugin is used.
