            <title>Comments</title>
            <p>
                Starting with blojsom 1.5, you have the ability to allow users to comment on your blog entries. By default,
                comments are enabled in the
                <em>blojsom.properties</em> that ships with blojsom.
            </p>
            <p>
                As indicated in the
                <link href="site:install">installation</link> documentation, the value for the
                <em>blog-comments-enabled</em>
                parameter can be either
                <em>true</em> or
                <em>false</em>. If set to true, blog comments are enabled globally
                on your blog. If set to false, no user may comment on blog entries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The
                <em>blog-comments-directory</em> parameter indicates the directory where blog comments
                will be written to under the blog category directories.  This directory is automatically
                added to the list of directories that get filtered by blojsom.
            </p>
            <p>
                When users are taken to the comments page for a blog entry, they are presented with a form
                where they can enter their name, e-mail address, URL (for a homepage or their own blog), and
                a comment. Users must enter, at a minimum, their name and a comment. Their e-mail address
                and URL are optional.
            </p>

                <title>Disabling comments on individual entries</title>
                <p>
                    If comments are enabled on your blog, but you do not want to allow users to comment on
                    an individual entry, you can do so by making that entry
                    <em>read-only</em>. blojsom uses
                    this to indicate whether or not it should allow users to comment on an entry. If a blog
                    entry is writable, users may comment on that entry.

                <p>
                    As of blojsom 1.8, support for the
                    <link href="http://wellformedweb.org/story/9">Comment API</link>
                    has been added to blojsom.

                <title>Banning IP addresses from commenting</title>
                <p>
                    In blojsom 1.9.1, both the Comment and Trackback plugins can ban IP addresses from posting comments
                    and trackbacks by specifying regular expressions for banned IP addresses. The list of banned IP
                    addresses is controlled by the
                    <em>blog-banned-ip-addresses</em> parameter in your individual
                    <em>/WEB-INF/(user-id)/blog.properties</em>.
                    As an example, the following will ban you from posting locally.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Expiration of the cookies for the "Remember Me" functionality in the
                    comments plugin can be controlled by the <em>plugin-comment-expiration-duration</em>
                    parameter in your individual <em>/WEB-INF/(user-id)/blog.properties</em>. This parameter is specified as
                    an integer value in number of seconds until expiration.

                <title>Enabling auto-formatting of comments</title>
                <p>
                    Add the following to your <em>/WEB-INF/(user-id)/blog.properties</em> if you would like to
                    enable auto-formatting of comments. This will turn all newline characters into &lt;br/&gt; tags.
                    <source>
                        plugin-comment-autoformat=true
                    </source>
