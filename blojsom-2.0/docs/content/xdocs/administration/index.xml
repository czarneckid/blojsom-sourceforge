            <p>
                blojsom uses a set of plugins to add web-based administration capabilities where you are able to
                edit authorized users who can post to your blog, modify blog properties, add/edit/delete entries,
                add/edit/delete blog categories, modify flavors, modify plugin chains, modify templates,
                upload files to your blog, and modify users of your blojsom installation.

            <title>Authorizing Users for the Administration Console</title>
            <p>
                Authorized users are added to the <code>/WEB-INF/(user-id)/authorization.properties</code> file.
                The usernames and passwords in this file control the users that can access the individual blog
                either via the administration console or XML-RPC. The format of this file is as follows.
                <source>
                    username=password
                </source>
                Each separate line represents an individual username and password combination.

            <title>Accessing the Administration Console</title>
            <p>
                blojsom reserves one of the flavors defined in the individual user's <em>flavor.properties</em> file
                for the administration functionality. The default administration flavor is <em>admin</em>. You can
                access the administration console of your blog by adding <em>?flavor=admin</em> when accessing your blog.
                At the login prompt for the administration console, use one of the authorized usernames and passwords
                that you setup in the <code>/WEB-INF/(user-id)/authorization.properties</code> file.
