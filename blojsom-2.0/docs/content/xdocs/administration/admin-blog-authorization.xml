                The Authorization Administration plugin allows you to add new authorized users, change the password for
                existing authorized users, and delete users from the authorization file for your blog. Authorized
                users have the ability to log into the administration console and access administrative functions
                through the console and are authorized to edit the blog remotely via XML-RPC.
