                The Plugins Administration plugin allows you to modify the plugins executed for the individual
                flavors of your blog. This is useful when you want to change how blog entries are processed before
                they are rendered in a particular flavor.

                In your global
                <code>plugin.properties</code> file, add the following line:
            </p>
            <source>
                edit-blog-plugins=org.blojsom.plugin.admin.EditBlogPluginsPlugin

            <title>Usage</title>
            <p>
                After logging into the administration console, you may click on the link to "Edit Blog Plugin Chains"
                and you will be able to modify the plugins executed for the individual flavors on your blog. Each
                entry for the flavor is a comma-separated list of plugin short names. A list of plugin short names
                is shown at the top of the page.
