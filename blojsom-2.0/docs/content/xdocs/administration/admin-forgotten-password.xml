                The Forgotten Password plugin allows authorized users to have their password sent by e-mail if
                for some reason they forget their password. E-mail addresses can be added to the
                <code>authorization.properties</code> file by separating the e-mail address with a "," after
                the password. Example:
                <pre>
                    username=password,email@address.com
                </pre>
                Any usernames without e-mail addresses are assume to be the property of the blog owner, so in these
                cases, a forgotten password e-mail message would be sent to the blog owner's e-mail address.
