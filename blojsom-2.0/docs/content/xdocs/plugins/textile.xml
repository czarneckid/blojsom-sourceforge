                The Textile plugin is an implementation of the amazing Textile Humane Web Text Generator.
                You can see the original at the
                <link href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textism Textile</link>
                site.

            <title>installation and setup</title>
            <p>
                In your global
                <code>plugin.properties</code> file, add the following line:
            </p>
            <source>
                textile=org.blojsom.plugin.textile.TextilePlugin
            </source>
            <p>
                You may then add "textile" to one of the flavor-based plugin chains.
                These plugin chains can be found in the individual user's
                <code>plugin.properties</code> file. For example:
            </p>
            <source>
                html.blojsom-plugin-chain=textile
            </source>
            <p>
                In your individual
                <code>blog.properties</code> file, be sure to add
                <code>.*textile</code> to the
                <em>blog-file-extensions</em> value.
                The textile plugin uses
                <strong>.textile</strong> to identify blog entries that should be passed through
                the plugin for processing, so be sure your entries end with this extension if you want this
                plugin to work correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The textile plugin can also be run on entries not ending in a <strong>.textile</strong> extension
                by using the metadata plugin before the textile plugin in one of the flavor-based plugin chains.
                The metadata key for the textile plugin would be specified as <em>meta-run-textile=y</em> on a
                separate line in your blog entry text.

                No context attributes are made available or used by the Textile plugin.

                h2. This is a title

                h3. This is a subhead

                This is some text of dubious character. Isn't the use of "quotes" just lazy writing -- and
                theft of 'intellectual property' besides? I think the time has come to see a block quote.

                bq. This is a block quote. I'll admit it's not the most exciting block quote ever devised.

                Well, that went well. How about we insert
                an &lt;a href="/" title="watch out"&gt;old-fashioned hypertext link&lt;/a&gt;?
                Will the quote marks in the tags get messed up? No!

                "This is a link (optional title)":http://www.textism.com

                An image:

                !/common/textist.gif(optional alt text)!

                # Librarians rule
                # Yes they do
                # But you knew that

                Some more text of dubious character. Here is a noisome string of CAPITAL letters.
                Here is something we want to _emphasize_.
                That was a linebreak. And something to indicate *strength*. Of course I could
                use &lt;em&gt;my own HTML tags&lt;/em&gt; if I &lt;strong&gt;felt&lt;/strong&gt; like it.

                h3. Coding

                This &lt;code&gt;is some code, "isn't it"&lt;/code&gt;. Watch those quote marks!
                Now for some preformatted text:

                &lt;pre&gt;
                &lt;code&gt;
                $text = str_replace("&lt;p&gt;%::%&lt;/p&gt;","",$text);
                $text = str_replace("%::%&lt;/p&gt;","",$text);
                $text = str_replace("%::%","",$text);

                &lt;/code&gt;
                &lt;/pre&gt;

                This isn't code.


                So you see, my friends:

                * The time is now
                * The time is not later
                * The time is not yesterday
                * We must act
